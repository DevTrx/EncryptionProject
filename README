# Secure File Vault

A lightweight Python-based file encryption tool that lets users securely encrypt and decrypt files using AES (via the `cryptography` library). Designed for educational and personal security projects.

##What It Does

-  Generates a secure symmetric encryption key (Fernet/AES-128 under the hood)
- Encrypts any file into an unreadable `.encrypted` format
- Decrypts files back to their original format using the saved key
- Command-line interface with clear prompts for beginners

##Why I Built It

I created this project to strengthen my understanding of:
- Encryption basics and key management
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Python scripting for cybersecurity tools

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced encryption projects and demonstrates core knowledge of secure file handling.
